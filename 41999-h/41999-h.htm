<p class="ac scac">of the</p>

<h3>OXFORD POCKET CLASSICS,</h3>

<p class="ac">A NEW SERIES OF THE GREEK AND
LATIN CLASSICS FOR THE USE OF
SCHOOLS.</p>

  <p>The want of a good Series of Greek and Latin Classics, suited to the
  Use of Schools, with the English mode of Punctuation, and under English
  Editorship, has long been felt; and it is a rather of wonder that our
  Schools should so long have been obliged to depend on Germany for
  accurate Greek and Latin texts.</p>

  <p>To meet this want, the "OXFORD POCKET CLASSICS" were commenced some
  years back, and each year has added some three or four authors to the
  collection.</p>

  <p>The Series now consists of about Thirty Volumes.</p>

  <p>The advantages of this Series of Classics are, that they are printed
  from the best texts extant; and not only this, but each volume has,
  during its progress through the press, been superintended by some
  competent member of the University. There have also been supplied, where
  necessary, SUMMARIES, CHRONOLOGICAL TABLES, BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES,
  INDICES, and the like&mdash;aids which are often wanting in other
  editions. Lastly, they are printed in a good plain type, and on a firm,
  fine paper, capable of receiving writing inks, for notes, and at the same
  time they are supplied at moderate prices.</p>

  <p>It is hoped that the advantages which the "OXFORD POCKET CLASSICS"
  possess over other Series will not fail to increase the circulation which
  they have already attained in both our public and private Schools, as
  also in our Universities.</p>

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>GRIFFIN'S "FIDESSA," AND SHAKSPEARE'S "PASSIONATE PILGRIM."</h3>

  <p>I am the fortunate possessor of a thin volume, entitled <i>Fidessa, a
  Collection of Sonnets</i>, by B. Griffin, reprinted 1811, from the
  edition of 1596, at the Chiswick Press; I presume, by the monogram at the
  end, by Mr. S. W. Singer.</p>

  <p>The title of the original edition is <i>Fidessa, more Chaste then
  Kinde</i>, by B. Griffin, Gent, at London, printed by the Widdow Orwin,
  for Matthew Lownes, 1596.</p>

  <p>The advertisement prefixed by Mr. Singer to the reprint states, that
  the original is one of the rarest of those that appeared at the period in
  which it is dated; that he is not aware of the existence of more than two
  copies, from one of which the reprint is taken, and that the other was in
  the curious collection of the late Mr. Malone.</p>

  <p>Besides the rarity of <i>Fidessa</i>, Mr. Singer states that it claims
  some notice from the curious reader on account of a very striking
  resemblance between Griffin's third sonnet, and one of Shakspeare's, in
  his <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i> (Sonnet <span class="sm">IX.</span>).</p>

  <p>I will transcribe both sonnets, taking Griffin's first, as it bears
  the earliest date.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Venus, and yong Adonis sitting by her,</p>
      <p class="i1">Under a myrtle shade began to woo him:</p>
      <p>She told the yong-ling how god Mars did trie her,</p>
      <p class="i1">And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the wanton god embrac'd me,'</p>
      <p class="i1">And then she clasp'd Adonis in her armes.</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god unlac'd me,'</p>
      <p class="i1">As if the boy should use like loving charms.</p>
      <p>But he, a wayward boy, refusde her offer,</p>
      <p class="i1">And ran away, the beautious Queene neglecting:</p>
      <p>Showing both folly to abuse her proffer,</p>
      <p class="i1">And all his sex of cowardice detecting.</p>
      <p>Oh! that I lead my mistris at that bay,</p>
      <p>To kisse and clippe me till I ranne away!"</p>
      <p class="i8">Sonnet <span class="sm">III.</span>, from <i>Fidessa</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Fair<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Venus, with Adonis sitting by her,</p>
      <p class="i1">Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him;</p>
      <p>She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,</p>
      <p class="i1">And as he fell to her, she fell to him.</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god embrac'd me,'</p>
      <p class="i1">And then she clipp'd Adonis in her arms:</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god unlac'd me,'</p>
      <p class="i1">As if the boy should use like loving charms:</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Even thus,' quoth she, 'he seized on my lips,'</p>
      <p class="i1">And with her lips on his did act the seizure;</p>
      <p>And as she fetched breath, away he skips,</p>
      <p class="i1">And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.</p>

      <p>To kiss and clip me till I run away!"</p>
      <p class="i2">Sonnet <span class="sm">IX.</span>, from Shakspeare's <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That the insertion of Griffin's sonnet in the <i>Passionate
  Pilgrim</i> was without Shakspeare's consent or knowledge, is in my
  opinion evident for many reasons.</p>

  <p>I have long been convinced that the <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i> was
  published surreptitiously; and although it bears Shakspeare's name, the
  sonnets and ballads of which it is composed were several of them taken
  from his dramas, and added to by selections from the poems of his
  cotemporaries, Raleigh, Marlow, and others; that it was a bookseller's
  job, made up for sale by the publisher, W. Jaggard.</p>

  <p>No one can believe that Shakspeare would have been guilty of such a
  gross plagiarism. Griffin's <i>Fidessa</i> bears date 1596: the first
  known edition of the <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i> was printed for W.
  Jaggard, 1599. It has no dedication to any patron, similar to
  Shakspeare's other poems, the <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, the <i>Rape of
  Lucrece</i>, and the <i>Sonnets</i>; and why it bears the title of the
  <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i> no one has ascertained.</p>

  <p>But I am losing sight of the object I had in view when I took up my
  pen, which was, through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," to request any of
  its readers to furnish me with any particulars of B. Griffin, the author
  of <i>Fidessa</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Singer supposes him to have been of a Worcestershire family; as he
  addresses his "poore pamphlet" for patronage to the gentlemen of the
  Innes of Court, he might probably have been bred to the law.</p>

  <p>Perhaps your correspondents <span class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span>, or
  <span class="sc">Mr. Noake</span>, the Worcestershire rambler, might in
  their researches into vestry registers and parish documents, find some
  notice of the family. I am informed there was a gentleman of the name
  resident in our college precincts early in the present century, that he
  was learned and respected, but very eccentric.</p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote1"></a><b>Footnote 1:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag1">(return)</a>
  <p>The early copies read "Venus, with Adonis sitting by her;" the
  defective word was added at Dr. Farmer's suggestion. Had he seen a copy
  of <i>Fidessa</i>, the true reading might perhaps have been restored.

<h3>CAPS AT CAMBRIDGE.</h3>

  <p>At the congregation in the Senate House at Cambridge, Nov. 23,
  presided over by the Prince Chancellor, it was observed that the
  undergraduates in the galleries (for want I suppose of an obnoxious
  Vice-Chancellor or Proctor upon whom to vent their indignation) poured it
  forth in yells and groans upon those members of the senate who kept on
  their hats or caps. The same has been done on several former occasions.
  It probably <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>arises from a mistake, in ascribing to the
  <i>gaucherie</i> of individuals what is really the observance of a very
  ancient custom. The following extract, from an unpublished MS. of the
  middle (I think) of the seventeenth century, in which the custom is
  incidentally noticed, will serve for a confirmation of what I say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When I was regent, the whole house of congregation joyned together in
  a petition to the Earle of Pembroke to restore unto us the jus pileorum,
  the licence of putting on our cappes at our publicke meetings; which
  priviledge time and the tyrannie of our vicechancellours had taken from
  us. Amongst other motives, we use the solemne forme of creating a
  M<sup>r</sup> in the Acte by putting on his cappe, and that that signe of
  libertie might distinguish us which were the Regents from those boyes
  which wee were to governe, which request he graciouslie granted."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was written by an M.A. of Oxford. At Cambridge we have not
  hitherto had such haughty despots in authority, to trample upon our
  rights; but we seem to be in danger of losing our jus pileorum through
  "the tyrannie," not of our Vice-Chancellors, but "of those boyes which
  wee are to governe."</p>

  <p>While there was any expectation of your Lordship's speedy return to
  England, I forbore to congratulate you on your late promotion. For though
  none of your friends could more truly rejoice at this news than I did,
  both on your own account, and that of the public; yet in the number of
  compliments which I was sensible you must receive on that occasion, I
  close rather to be silent for fear of being troublesome. But as I find it
  is now uncertain, when your affairs may permit of your return hither, I
  could not omit this opportunity by your good Lady to express my hearty
  congratulation upon the due regard shown by the Government to your just
  merit; and shall think it an honour to be continued in your esteem as
  <i>ultimus amicorum</i>.</p>

  <p>I doubt not but your Lordship has seen Mr. Horsley's <i>Britannia
  Romana</i> advertised in some of our public Papers; but I know not
  whether you have heard that the author died soon after he had finished
  the work, before its publication. When it was hoped that the credit of
  this book might have been of some service to him and his large family, he
  was suddenly and unexpectedly taken off by an Apoplexy. Such is the
  uncertainty of all human affairs. That your Lordship may be long
  preserved in your high station for the good of the Protestant Religion,
  and the support of public liberty, are the sincere wishes of,</p>

  <p>After my most humble thanks for the continuation of Westminster
  Elections you was so kind as to give me, I must acquit myself of my
  promise; and therefore I herewith send your Lordship a copy transcrib'd
  exactly from the MS. given me by Dr. South himself of his verses upon
  Westminster School, with his name, and the year subscribed at bottom.
  They were indeed publish'd among his <i>Opera Posthuma Latina Anon.</i>
  1717, by Curl, after his impudent way of dealing with dead authors'
  works; and sometimes also with those of the living.</p>

  <p>Your Lordship by this may see how much this sawcy fellow has abused
  this learned man's fine copy of verses; and how justly he deserved the
  correction which was inflicted on him at that school.</p>

  <p>By the tenth Distich it appears that the School (containing then
  <i>Tercentum juvenes</i>) was managed by three Masters onely: and, for
  aught we know, might flourish pretty well, though it had not twice that
  number.</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Dear Sir,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It either is, or seems to be, a long time since I heard from you.
  Perhaps you are writing the very same sentence to me; but as the loss is
  on my side, you must give me leave to complain.</p>

  <p>This summer has passed away in great idleness and feasting: so that I
  have scarce looked into a book of any sort. Mrs. Pilkington and Con.
  Philips, however, have not escaped me. I was obliged to read them to
  adapt myself to the conversation of my neighbours, who have talked upon
  no other topic, notwithstanding the more glorious subjects of Peace, and
  Lord Anson's voyage. The truth is, we are better acquainted with the
  stile of Con. and Pilky, than with the hard names and distant places that
  are mentioned in the Voyage round the World.</p>

  <p>I have not peeped into the Anti-Lucretius: it is arrived at Caledon,
  and reserved for the longest evenings. Carte's voluminous History is
  weighing down one of my shelves. He likewise is postponed to bad weather,
  or a fit of the gout. Last week brought us the first Number of Con's
  second volume. She goes on triumphantly, and is very entertaining. Her
  sister Pilkington is not so fortunate. She has squandered away the money
  she gained by her first volume, and cannot print her second. But from
  you, I hope to hear of books of another sort. A thin quarto named
  <i>Louthiana</i> is most delicately printed, and the cuts admirably
  engraved: and yet we think the County of Louth the most devoid of
  Antiquities of any County in Ireland. The County of Corke is, I believe,
  in the press; and I am told it will be well executed. I have seen the
  County of Waterford, and approve of it very much. These kind of Books are
  owing to an Historical Society formed at Dublin, and of great use to this
  kingdom, which is improving in all Arts and Sciences very fast: tho' I
  own to you, the cheapness of French Claret is not likely to add much at
  present to the encrease of literature. If all true Hibernians could bring
  themselves to be of your opinion and Pindar's, the glorious memory of
  King William might keep the head cool, and still warm the heart; but,
  alas, it sets both on fire: and till these violent fits of bacchanalian
  loyalty are banished from our great tables, I doubt few of us shall ever
  rise higher in our reading than the Memoirs of that kind I first
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>I am, Dear Sir, and so is all my family, truly</p>

<h3>NEWSPAPER FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p>The following paragraph is now going the round of the newspapers
  without reference to the source of information. I copy it from the
  <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of Friday, December 9.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Escape of a Snake from a Man's Mouth.</i>&mdash;An extraordinary
  circumstance occurred a few days ago to Jonathan Smith, gunner's mate,
  who was paid off at Portsmouth on the 6th of May last, from her Majesty's
  ship Hastings, 72 guns, on her return to England from the East Indies. He
  obtained six weeks' leave. On the expiration of that time, after seeing
  his friends at Chatham, he joined the Excellent, gunnery-ship at
  Portsmouth. After some time he was taken unwell, <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>his illness increased,
  and he exhibited a swelling in his stomach and limbs. The surgeon
  considering that it arose from dropsy, he was removed into Haslar
  Hospital, and after much painful suffering, although he had every
  attention paid to him by the medical officers of the establishment, he
  died. Two hours before his death a living snake, nine inches in length,
  came out of his mouth, causing considerable surprise. How the reptile got
  into his stomach is a mystery. It is supposed that the deceased must have
  swallowed the reptile when it was young, drinking water when the Hastings
  was out in India, as the ship laid for some time at Trincomalee, and
  close to a small island called Snake Island. The crew used very often to
  find snakes on board. The way they used to get into the ship was by the
  cable, and through the hawsers into the forecastle. The deceased was
  forty years of age. He was interred in Kingston churchyard. His remains
  were followed to the grave by the ship's company of the Excellent."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The proverbial wisdom of the serpent is here clearly exemplified. It
  has long been well known among sailors that rats have the sense to change
  their quarters when a vessel becomes cranky; whence I believe arises the
  epithet "rat," which is sometimes scurrilously applied to a politic man
  who removes to the opposition benches when he perceives symptoms of
  dissolution in the ministry. The snake, in the simple narrative above
  quoted, was evidently guided by some such prudential motive when he
  quitted the stomach of the dying sailor, which could not continue for any
  great length of time to afford protection and support to the cunning
  reptile.</p>

  <p>I have an amiable friend who habitually swallows with avidity the
  tales of sea-serpents which are periodically imported into this country
  on American bottoms, and I have sufficient credulity myself to receive,
  without strict examination into evidence, the account of the swarming of
  the snakes up the cables into a ship; but I cannot so readily believe
  that "considerable surprise" was caused in the mind of any rational biped
  by the fact that a living snake, which had attained to the length of nine
  inches, took the very natural precaution to come out of a dying man's
  mouth.</p>

  <p>How the reptile got into his stomach is a mystery which the newspaper
  writer has attempted to clear up, but he has not attempted to explain how
  the reptile managed to live during many months in so unusual a habitation
  as a man's stomach.</p>

  <p>Some obliging correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." will perhaps have the
  kindness to explain this remarkable fact in natural history.</p>

<h3>KING JAMES'S IRISH ARMY LIST OF 1689-90.</h3>

  <p>In last September I undertook a literary project, which I think could
  be greatly aided through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," as there are few
  families in the empire that are not connected with its details, and who
  might therefore be expected to feel interested in them. The project I
  allude to is a publication of King James's Irish Army List of 1689-90.
  King I must call him in reference to that list. Those that appear upon it
  were many his creedmen, and all his devoted adherents. The list, of which
  I have a copy in MS., extends over thirty-four pages octavo. The first
  two are filled with the names of all the colonels; the four ensuing are
  rolls of the regiments of horse; the four next, of the dragoons; and the
  remaining twenty-four record the foot: each regiment being arranged, with
  the colonel, lieutenant-colonel, and major at head, and the captains,
  lieutenants, cornets or ensigns, and quarter-masters, in columns, on each
  respectively. To every regiment I proposed to append notices, historic
  and genealogical, to the extent of, perhaps, eight hundred pages or more,
  for the compilation of which I have ample materials in my own MS.
  collections. These notices I propose to furnish under him of the name who
  ranks highest on the list; and all the scattered officers of that name
  will be collected in that one article.</p>

  <p>After an especial and full notice of such officer, to when the family
  article is attached, his parentage, individual achievements, descendants,
  &amp;c., each illustration will briefly glance at the genealogy of that
  family, with, if an Irish sept, its ancient localities; if an English or
  Scotch, the county from whence it branched, and the period when it
  settled here.</p>

  <p>I would next identify each family, so illustrated, with its attainders
  and forfeitures in 1641;</p>

  <p>With the great Assembly of Confederate Catholics at Kilkenny in
  1646;</p>

  <p>With the persons denounced by name in Cromwell's ordinance of 1652,
  "for <i>settling</i> Ireland;"</p>

  <p>With the declaration of royal gratitude to the Irish exiles who served
  King Charles II. "in parts beyond the seas," as contained in the <i>Act
  of Explanation</i> of 1665;</p>

  <p>With (if space allowable) those advanced by James II. to civil
  offices, as sheriffs, &amp;c., or members of his new corporations;</p>

  <p>With those who represented Irish counties or boroughs in the
  Parliament of Dublin in 1689;</p>

  <p>With the several outlawries and confiscations of 1691, &amp;c.;</p>

  <p>With else claims that were subsequently (in 1703) preferred as charges
  on these forfeitures, and how far allowed or dismissed;</p>

  <p>And, lastly, as far as attainable, their achievements in the glorious
  engagements of the Spanish and French Brigades: <!-- Page 31 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span></p>

  <p>All statements throughout being <i>verified by authorities</i>.</p>

  <p>Already have I compiled and arranged the materials for illustrating
  the eight regiments of horse upon this roll, viz. Tyrconnel's, Galmoy's,
  Sarsfield's, Abercorn's, Luttrell's, Sutherland's, Parker's, and
  Purcell's; a portion of the work in which, according to my plan, the
  illustrations will be appropriated to the families of&mdash;</p>

  <p>And this section (about 100 pages) is open to inspection on

  <p>The above is but a tithe of the surnames whose genealogical
  illustrations I propose to furnish. The succeeding portions of the work,
  comprising six regiments of Dragoons, and upwards of fifty of Foot, will

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Authors and Publishers.</i>&mdash;As "N. &amp; Q." is, I believe,
  much read by booksellers as well as authors, would not both parties find
  great advantage by the latter advertising in your pages the completion
  and wished-for publication of any work on which they may have been
  engaged? Publishers, in this way, might hear of works which they would be
  glad to bring before the public, and authors be spared much unnecessary
  and often useless trouble and correspondence. Authors, I know, may feel
  some delicacy in coming before the world in this manner <i>before</i>
  publication, although after that rubicon is passed, their names and
  productions are blazoned on the winds; but as a previous announcement in
  "N. &amp; Q." may be made <i>anonymously</i>, as respects the name of the
  writer, although not of course as regards the nature of his work, there
  seems no just reason why honorable and beneficial arrangements may not be
  made in this way as well as by any other. To me this plan seems to offer
  some advantages, and I throw out the hint for the consideration of all
  whom it may concern.<a name="footnotetag2"

</div>
  <p><i>Inscriptions on old Pulpits.</i>&mdash;"N. &amp; Q." has given many
  kinds of inscriptions, from those on Fonts and Door-heads down to those
  on Watch-papers; perhaps, therefore, it may not be without its use or
  interest to make a beginning for a list of inscriptions on old pulpits.
  The first inscription I quote is from Richard Baxter's pulpit, of which I
  have given a full description in Vol. v., p. 363.:</p>

  <p>1. Kidderminster. Baxter's pulpit (now preserved in the vestry of the
  Unitarian Chapel). On the panels of the pulpit:</p>

<p class="ac">"ALICE . DAWKX . WIDOW . GAVE . THIS."</p>

  <p>On the front of the preacher's desk:</p>

<p class="ac">"PRAISE . THE . LORD."</p>

  <p>Round the sounding-board:</p>

<p class="ac">"O . GIVE . THANKS . UNTO . THE . LORD . AND . CALL<br/>
UPON . HIS . NAME . DECLARE . HIS . WORSHIP<br/>
AMONG . THE . PEOPLE."</p>

  <p>At the back of the pulpit:</p>

<p class="ac">"ANNO . 1621."</p>

  <p>2. Suckley, Worcestershire; round the sounding-board (apparently of
  very old date):</p>

<p class="ac">"BLESSED . ARE . THEY . THAT . HEAR . THE . WORDE . OF<br/>
GOD . AND . KEEPE . IT."</p>

  <p>3. Broadwas, Worcestershire; on the panels:</p>

<p class="ac">"WILLIAM . NOXON . AND . ROGER . PRINCE . C . W . 1632."</p>

  <p>Round the sounding-board, the same text as at Suckley.</p>

  <p><i>Recent Curiosities of Literature.</i>&mdash;Thackeray, in the
  second number of <i>The Newcomes</i>, describes an old lady's death as
  being caused from her head having been <i>cut</i> with a bed-room
  <i>candle</i>. N. P. Willis, in his <i>Health Trip to the Tropics</i>,
  speaks <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>of being waited on by a Carib, who had "no
  beard except a long moustache." Professor Spalding, of St. Andrew's in
  his <i>History of English Literature</i>, says that the sonnets of
  Wordsworth "have <i>perfection</i> hardly to be <i>surpassed</i>." And J.
  Stanyan Bigg (the "new poet"), in the December number of Hogg's
  <i>Instructor</i>, exclaims:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p><i>Assuming Names.</i>&mdash;Last Term, in the Court of Exchequer,
  application was made by counsel to add a surname to the name of an
  attorney on the roll; he having been left property with a wish expressed
  that he should take the surname in addition to his own, which he had
  done, but not by royal license. The court granted the application.

  <p><i>False Dates in Water-marks of Papers.</i>&mdash;Lately, in cutting
  up some paper for photographic purposes, I found in one and the same
  quire two sheets without any mark, two of the date 1851, nine bearing the
  date 1853, and the remaining eleven were 1854. I can imagine a case might
  occur in which the authenticity of a document might be much questioned
  were it dated 1853, when the paper would be presumed not to have been
  made until a year afterwards. I think this is worth making a note of not
  only by lawyers, but those interested in historical documents.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN FARRE.</h3>

  <p>I send you a Note and a Query respecting the same person. Many years
  since, I passed a few days in one of the wildest spots in the south of
  England&mdash;Hawkley, in the neighbourhood of Selbourne. On a visit to
  the church of Emshott or Empshot, I heard that the screen had been
  presented by a Captain Farre, whose memory was in some way connected with
  the days of the republic; and on farther inquiry tradition, it appeared,
  had come to the conclusion that Farre had been one of the regicides who
  had retired into the neighbourhood, and lived and died there in a sort of
  concealment. I found out, also, the house in which he had lived: a pretty
  modest cottage, in which a small farmer resided. I was struck, on
  approaching it, by the beauty of the brick-work of the little porch,
  which appeared to have been an addition to the original building. On
  entering the cottage, I found that the kitchen and bed-room only were
  occupied by the family; the <i>one room</i>, which <i>had been</i> the
  sitting-room, being used as a granary. The ceiling of this room was
  ponderous, with a deep rich sunken panelling. The little porch-entrance
  and the ceiling of this room were so out of character with the cottage,
  and indeed with all around, that I caused search to be made in the
  Registers of the parish to see if I could find some trace of this Captain
  Farre; and I now send you the result. There was no regicide of that name;
  but Col. Phaer was one of those to whom the warrant for the execution of
  Charles was addressed: and he certainly was not one of the twenty-nine
  subsequently tried for the high treason as it was called. What became of
  him I know not. Whether he reappeared here as Capt. Farre, or who Capt.
  Farre was, I shall leave to the speculation of the better informed. There
  were many Farrs and Phaers <i>out</i> in the great Revolution, and the
  name is sometimes spelt one way, sometimes the other. Empshot, under Nore
  Hill or Noah Hill, was certainly an excellent place for concealment. The
  neighbourhood was, and is, as White said, "famous for its oaks, and
  infamous for its roads."</p>

<h3>MARRIAGE CEREMONY IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

  <p>Will some one of your correspondents (learned in such matters) refer
  me to a work treating of the marriage ceremony as performed in this
  country during the fourteenth century, in order to the explanation of the
  following passages, which refer to an event in English history&mdash;the
  marriage of Edward I.'s daughter with the Count of Holland? The king's
  writ to the Bishop of London speaks of the marriage as about to be
  celebrated on the day after the Epiphany, upon which day (as shown by the
  Wardrobe Account) the ring was put on; but it was on the next day (the
  8th) that the princess "despon<span class="over">s</span> fuit," as shown
  by the same account.</p>

  <p>In Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, vol. i. p. 850., will be found a writ
  directed to the Bishop of London (and others) as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quia inter Comitem Holandiæ et Elizabetham, filiam nostram
  carissimam, <i>matrimonium</i> hac proxima die Lunæ, <i>in crastino
  Epiphaniæ</i>, apud Gyppesivicum solempnizari proponimus, Domino
  concedente," &amp;c.</p>

<h3>MANUSCRIPT CATENA.</h3>

  <p>About four years ago I purchased, at the sale of the museum of Mr.
  George Bell of Whitehaven, a folio vellum MS. in Latin, written
  apparently in the fourteenth century: containing a Catena, or a series of
  notes on the Epistles to the Romans and Corinthians, selected from the
  Fathers of the Church, viz. Origines, Ambrosius, Gregorius, Jeronimus,
  Augustinus, Cassianus, Beda, Lambertus, Lanfrancus, Anselmus, and Ivo
  Carnotensis. As many of those authors were English, I infer that the
  volume was compiled in England for some English monastery.</p>

  <p>The beginning of each chapter is noted on the margin, but there is no
  division into verses. The sentences, or short paragraphs of the text, are
  written in vermillion, and the comments upon them in black: those
  comments are generally taken from one, but often from two or three
  authors; the names of each being stated. There are large handsome
  capitals at the beginning of each book, and the initials to the
  paragraphs are distinguished by a spot of red, but there are no
  illuminations. Two leaves have been cut out at the beginning of the
  volume; a few at two or three places throughout the volume, and at the
  end, by some former possessor. As the style of binding is very uncommon,
  I will describe it. It was bound in oak boards of half an inch thick; the
  sheets were sewed on thongs of white leather, similar to what cart
  harness is stitched with. Instead of the thongs being brought <i>over</i>
  the back edges of the boards (as in modern binding), they are inserted
  into mortices in the edges of the boards, and then laced through holes,
  and secured with glue and wedges. The boards were covered first with
  allumed leather, and over that seal-skin <i>with the hair on</i>. The
  board at the beginning of the book had four feet, placed near the
  corners, of nearly an inch in height, half an inch in diameter at the
  base, and about a quarter of an inch at the point. Each was cast in one
  piece, with a circular base of about an inch and a quarter in diameter,
  and rising towards the centre; and they were each fastened on by three
  pins or nails. The board at the end of the book was ornamented with four
  circular brass plates about the size of a halfpenny, placed near the
  corners; having in the centre of each a stud, the head of which
  represented a prominent close flower of four petals. And in the centre of
  the board, there had been a stud or button, on which to fasten the strap
  from the other board to keep the book shut. Only one stud and one foot
  remained; but the places where the others had been were easily seen. I
  presume that the volume was meant to lie on a lectern or reading-desk,
  resting on its feet; and when opened out, the other board rested on its
  studs, as both were worn smooth with use.</p>

  <p>The binding being loose, and the cover torn to shreds (part of which
  was held on by the stud), I got the book rebound as nearly as possible in
  the same manner as the first, only substituting Russia leather for the
  unsightly seal-skin; and the remaining stud and foot afforded patterns,
  from which others were cast to supply the places of those deficient.</p>

  <p>Nothing is known of the history of this volume, except that it was
  purchased by Mr. Bell from Alexander Campbell, a bookseller in Carlisle.
  I am inclined to think, that it had belonged to some monastery in
  Cumberland; and the <i>seal-skin</i> cover would seem to indicate Calder
  Abbey (which is near <i>the coast</i>, where seals might be caught) as
  its original owner.</p>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents inform me, from the marks which I have
  given, whether this is a <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span>copy of <i>some known work</i> or an
  original compilation? And if the former, state where the original MS. is
  preserved; and if <i>printed</i>, the particulars of the edition?</p>

  <p>If my MS. can be ascertained to have formerly belonged to any library
  or individual, I shall be glad to learn any particulars of its
  history.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Jews and Egyptians.</i>&mdash;Has any writer ever started the idea
  that the early colonisers of some of the Grecian states, who are commonly
  stated to have been Egyptians, may have been, in fact, Jews? It seems to
  me that a good deal might be said in favour of this hypothesis, for the
  following reasons, amongst others:</p>

  <p>1. The Egyptian tradition preserved by Hecatæus, and quoted from him
  by Diodorus, that Danaus and Cadmus were leaders of minor branches of the
  great emigration, of which the main body departed under the guidance of
  Moses.</p>

  <p>2. The near coincidence in point of time, as far as can be traced, of
  the appearance of Danaus, Cadmus, and Cecrops, in Greece, with the Jewish
  exodus.</p>

  <p>3. The letter, preserved by Josephus, of Areus, king of Sparta, to the
  high-priest of the Jews, claiming a common descent with the latter from
  Abraham, and proposing an alliance. It is difficult to explain this claim
  on any other supposition than that Areus had heard of the tradition
  mentioned by Diodorus, and, as he and his people traced their descent
  from Danaus through Hercules, they consequently regarded themselves as
  sprung from a common stock with the Hebrews.</p>

  <p>I throw out this theory for the consideration of others, having myself
  neither leisure nor opportunity for pushing the subject any farther; but
  still I think that a distinguished statesman and novelist, who amused the
  world some years ago by endeavouring to trace most of the eminent men of
  modern times to a Jewish origin, might, with at least as much reason,
  claim most of the glories of ancient Greece for his favourite people.</p>

  payments, one of 133<i>l.</i> "for cloth to the great ministers of
  state," the city being bound by an old charter to give a certain amount
  of cloth annually to them. He subsequently states that this custom is
  supposed to be connected with the encouragement of the wool manufacture
  in its early history; and that four and a half yards of the finest black
  cloth that the country can produce are annually sent to the First
  Secretary of State, the Second Secretary of State, the Lord Chancellor,
  the Chamberlain of the Household, the Vice-Chancellor of the Household,
  the Treasurer of the Household, the Lord Steward, the Controller, the

  1770; and his only daughter married Thomas Astle, Esq., F.R.S. and F.A.S.
  He was son of Stephen Morant. If any of the sons or daughters of that

  probable Mr. Charles Fleetwood, who was buried at Stoke Newington, May
  14, 1676, was his son by the Protector's daughter, as perhaps was Ellen

<h3>THE ASTEROIDS OR RECENTLY DISCOVERED LESSER PLANETS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 211.; Vol. viii., p. 601.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Quæstor</span> has asked me a question to which I
  will not refuse a reply. If he thinks that the breaking up of a planetary
  world is a mere fancy, he may consult Sir John Herschel's
  <i>Astronomy</i>, § 434., in Lardner's series, ed. 1833, in which the
  supposition was treated as doubtful, and farther discoveries were
  declared requisite for its confirmation; and Professor Mitchell's
  <i>Discoveries of Modern Astronomy</i>, Lond. 1850, pp. 163-171., where
  such discoveries are detailed, and the progress of the proof is narrated
  and explained. It may be briefly stated as follows:&mdash;In the last
  century, Professor Bode discovered the construction of a regular series
  of numbers, in coincidence with which the distances of all the known
  planets from the sun had been arranged by their Creator, saving one
  exception. Calling the earth's solar distance 10, the next numbers in the
  series are 16, 28, 52. The distances answering to 16 and 52, on this
  scale, are respectively occupied by the planets Mars and Jupiter; but the
  position of 28 seemed unoccupied. It was not likely that the Creator
  should have left the methodical order of his work incomplete. A few
  patient observers agreed, therefore, to divide amongst themselves that
  part of the heavens which a planet revolving at the vacant distance might
  be expected to traverse; and that each should keep up a continuous
  examination of the portion assigned to him. And the result was the
  discovery by Piazzi, in 1801, of a planet revolving at the expected solar
  distance, but so minute that the elder Herschel computed its diameter to
  be no more than 163 miles. The discovery of a second by Olbers, in the
  <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page37"></a>{37}</span>following year, led him to conjecture and
  suggest that these were fragments of a whole, which, at its first
  creation, had occupied the vacant position, with a magnitude not
  disproportionate to that assigned to the other planets. Since then there
  have been, and continue to be, discoveries of more and more such
  fragmental planets, all moving at solar distances so close upon that
  numbered 28, as to pass each other almost, as has been said, within
  peril; but in orbits which seem capriciously elevated and depressed, when
  referred to the planes assigned for the course of the regular planets; so
  that, to most minds capable of appreciating these facts, it will seem
  that Olber's conjecture has been marvellously confirmed.</p>

  <p>As to the theological conjecture appended to it in my previous
  communication, about which <span class="sc">Quæstor</span> particularly
  questions me, I can only say, that if he deems it rash or wrong, I have
  no right to throw the blame of it on any other man's shoulders, as I am
  not aware of its having been hazarded by any one else. But I hope he will
  agree with me, that if there has been a disruption of a planetary world,
  it cannot have arisen from any mistake or deficiency in the Creator's
  work or foresight, but should be respectfully regarded as the result of
  some moral cause.</p>

  to make reciprocal presents of trinkets ornamented with the natal stones.
  The stones and their influences, corresponding with each month, are

  lithomancy. Twelve anagrams of the name of God were engraved on twelve

  <p>These stones had also reference to the twelve tribes of Israel, twelve

  twelve hierarchies of devils, &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>usque ad

  <p>It is evident that all this absurd nonsense was founded on the twelve

  that in the glorious description of the Holy City, in Revelation xxi.,
  the mystical number twelve is again connected with precious stones.</p>

<h3>NON-RECURRING DISEASES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 516.)</p>

  <p>To give a full and satisfactory answer to the questions here proposed
  would involve so much professional and physiological detail, as would be
  unsuited to the character of such a publication as "N. &amp; Q." I will
  therefore content myself with short categorical replies, agreeable to the
  present state of our knowledge of these mysteries of the animal economy.
  It is true as a general rule that the infectious diseases, particularly
  the exanthemata, or those attended by eruption&mdash;the measles for
  example&mdash;occur but once. But there are exceptional cases, and the
  most virulent of these non-recurrent diseases, such even as small-pox,
  are sometimes taken a second time, and are then sometimes, though by no
  means always, fatal.</p>

  <p>Why all the mammalia (for, be it observed, these diseases are not
  confined to the human race) are subject to these accidents, or why the
  animal economy should be subject to such a turmoil at all, or, being so
  subject, why the susceptibility to the recurrence of the morbid action
  should exist, or be revived in some and not in others; and why in the
  majority of persons it should be extinguished at once and for ever,
  remain amongst the arcana of Nature, to which, as yet, the physiology of
  all the Hunters, and the animal chemistry of all the Liebigs, give no
  solution.</p>

  <p>Those persons who take note of the able, and in general highly
  instructive, reports of the Registrar of Public Health, will observe that
  the word <i>zymotic</i> is now frequently used to signify the
  introduction into the body of some morbific poisons,&mdash;such as
  prevail in the atmosphere, or are thrown off by diseased bodies, or
  generated in the unwholesome congregation of a crowded population, which
  are supposed to act like yeast in a beer vat, exciting ferments in the
  constitution, in the case of the infections diseases, similar to those
  which gave them birth. But this explains nothing, and only shifts the
  difficulty and changes the terms, and is no better than a modification of
  the opinions of our forefathers, who attributed all such disorders to a
  fermentation of the supposed "humours" of the body. The essence of these
  changes in the animal economy, like other phenomena of the living
  principle, remain, and perhaps ever will remain, an unfathomable mystery.
  It is our business to investigate, as much as in our power, and by a slow
  and cautious induction, the laws by which they are governed.</p>

  <p>Non-recurrence, or immunity from any future seizure in a person who
  has had an infectious disease, seems derivable from some invisible and
  unknown <i>impression</i><a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> made on the constitution. There is
  good reason to suppose that this impression may <i>vary in degree</i> in
  different individuals, and in the same individual at different times; and
  thence some practical inferences are to be drawn which have not yet been
  well advanced into popular view, but to which I cannot advert unless some
  reader of "N. &amp; Q." put the question.</p>

  <p class="author">M. (2)</p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote4"></a><b>Footnote 4:</b><a

  <p>This word is used for want of a better, to signify some unknown
  change.</p>

<h3>MILTON'S WIDOW.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 594. &amp;c.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Garlichithe's</span> apologies to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> are due, not so much for neglecting his
  communications as for misquoting them. We all owe an apology to your
  readers for keeping up so pertinaciously a subject of which I fear they
  will begin to be tired.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> has <i>not</i> stated that Richard
  Minshull of Chester, son of Richard Minshull, the writer of the letter of
  May 3, 1656, was born in 1641. What <span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span>
  <i>did</i> state (Vol. viii., p. 200.) was, that Mrs. Milton's brother,
  Richard Minshull of Wistaston, was baptized on April 7 in that year; and
  the statement is quite correct, as I can vouch, from having examined the
  baptismal register. Richard Minshull of Chester was aged forty or
  forty-one at the date of his father's letter, as shown below; but even if
  he had been aged only fifteen, as supposed by <span
  class="sc">Garlichithe</span>, I do not see that there is anything in the
  language of the letter to call for observation. He had conveyed to his
  father a communication from Randle Holmes, and the father writes in
  answer,&mdash;"Deare and loveing sonne, my love and best respects to you
  and to my daughter [<span class="sc">Garlichithe</span> may read
  daughter-in-law if he likes, but I see no necessity for it], tendered
  w<sup>th</sup> trust of y<sup>r</sup> health. I have reaceived Mr.
  Alderman Holmes his letter, together with y<sup>rs</sup>, wherin I
  understand that you desire to know what I can say concerning our coming
  out of Minshull House;" and he proceeds to give the information asked
  for.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Garlichithe</span>, in his former communication,
  confounds Randle the great-grandfather with Randle the great-grandson,
  and in his present one he confounds Richard Minshull of Chester, the
  uncle, with Richard Minshull of Wistaston, the nephew. I agree with <span
  class="sc">Garlichithe</span> that "he, Richard, the writer of the said
  letter, must be <i>fairly presumed</i> to have been married at the date
  of such letter," which he addresses to his "Deare and loveing sonne;" but
  what of that? Whom he married, your readers are informed at p. 595. He
  died in the year following his letter, at the ripe age of eighty-six.</p>

  <p>The misquotations noticed above would, if not pointed out, lead to
  inextricable confusion of facts; and I am compelled therefore again to
  <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>trouble you. In order, if possible, to set
  the matter at rest, I will put together in the form of a pedigree,
  compressed so as to be fit for insertion in your columns, the material
  facts which have been the subject of so much discussion; but, before
  doing so, permit me a word of protest against some of the communications
  alluded to, which are scarcely fair to "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p>A correspondent (Vol. vii., p. 596.) asks for information as to
  Milton's widow, and <span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> (Vol. viii., p.
  12.) refers him to a volume in which will be found the information asked
  for, and gives a brief outline of the facts there stated. On this <span
  class="sc">Garlichithe</span> (Vol. viii., p. 134.), misquoting <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span>, calls his attention to Mr. Hunter's letter,
  which, if <span class="sc">Garlichithe</span> had availed himself of the
  reference furnished to him, he would have found duly noticed. A second
  correspondent, <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>, whose literary
  services render me unwilling to find fault with him (Vol. viii., p.
  471.), heading his article with five references, of which not one is
  correct, suggests as new evidence the very documents to which <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> had furnished a reference; and a third, T.
  P. L. (quoting an anonymous pamphlet), jumps at once to the conclusion
  that "there can be little doubt" the author derived his information from
  an authentic source, "and, if so, it seems pretty clear"&mdash;that all
  the evidence supplied by heralds' visitations, wills, and title-deeds is
  to be discarded as idle fiction. Such objections as these, and the
  replies which they have rendered necessary, are, with the exception of
  the valuable contribution of <span class="sc">Mr. Arthur Paget</span>,
  the staple of the contributions which have filled so much of your
  valuable space.</p>

  <p>I conclude with my promised pedigree, the authorities for which are
  the Cheshire Visitation of 1663-4, and the Lancashire Visitation of
  1664-5, confirmed by the letter to Randle Holmes, and the legal documents
  published by the Chetham Society:</p>

<h3>TABLE-TURNING.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 57. 398.)</p>

  <p>One of the most distinguished men of science in France, M. Chevreul,
  the editor (late or present) of the <i>Annales de Chimie</i>, &amp;c.,
  has commenced a series of articles in the <i>Journal des Savants</i> on
  the subject of the divining-rod, the exploring pendulum, table-turning,
  &amp;c., his intention being to investigate scientifically the phenomena
  presented in these instances. Having formerly written much on the occult
  sciences and being a veteran in experimental science, M. Chevreul was
  generally deemed better qualified than most men living to throw light on
  the intervention of a principle whose influence he thinks he has proved
  by his own proper experience. It will be better to quote his own
  language:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ce principe concerne le <i>développement en nous d'une action
  musculaire qui n'est pas le produit d'une volonté, mais le résultat d'une
  pensée qui se porte sur un phénomène du monde extérieur sans
  préoccupation de l'action musculaire indispensable à la manifestation du
  phénomène</i>. Cet énonce sera développé lorsque nous l'appliquerons à
  l'explication des faits observés par nous, et deviendra parfaitement
  clair, nous l'espérons, lorsque le lecteur verra qu'il est l'expression
  précise de ces mêmes faits."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A farther quotation (if it should not prove too long for "N. &amp;
  Q.") from M. Chevreul's <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>preliminary remarks will be thought
  interesting by many persons:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"En définitive, nous espérons montrer d'une manière précise comment
  des gens d'esprit, sous l'influence de l'amour du merveilleux, si naturel
  à l'homme, franchissent la limite du connu, du fini, et, dès lors,
  comment, ne sentant pas le besoin de soumettre à un examen réfléchi
  l'opinion nouvelle qui leur arrive sous le cachet du merveilleux et du
  surnaturel, ils adoptent soudainement ce qui, étudié froidement,
  rentrerait dans le domaine des faits aux causes desquels il est donné à
  l'homme de remonter. Existe-t-il une preuve plus forte de l'amour de
  l'homme pour le merveilleux, que l'accueil fait de nos jours aux tables
  tournantes? Nous ne le pensons pas. Plus d'un esprit fort, qui accuse ses
  pères de crédulité en rejetant leurs traditions religieuses contemporains
  de Louis XIV., ont repoussé comme impossible un traité de chimère. Ce
  fait confirme ce que nous avons dit de la crédulité à propos de
  l'<i>Essai sur la Magie</i> d'Eusèbe Salverte, car si l'esprit fort qui
  repousse la révélation ne s'appuie pas sur la méthode scientifique propre
  à discerner l'erreur de la vérité, l'incertain du fait démontré, il sera
  sans cesse exposé à adopter comme vraies les opinions les plus bizarres,
  les plus erronées, ou du moins les plus contestables."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The two articles hitherto published by M. Chevreul in the <i>Journal
  des Savants</i> for the months of October and November, extend only to
  the first-mentioned subject of these inquiries, the divining-rod. The
  world will probably wait with some impatience to learn the final views of
  so eminent a scientific man.</p>

<h3>CELTIC ETYMOLOGY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 229. 551.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent is a very Antæus. He has fallen again upon
  <i>uim</i>, and he rises up from it to defend the <i>Heapian</i>
  pronunciation with renewed vigour. But I cannot admit that he has proved
  the pedigree of <i>humble</i> from the Gaelic.</p>

  <p>But, even if <i>uim</i> were the root of a Sanscrit word, and not
  itself a derivative, still the many stages through which the derivation
  undoubtedly passes, without any need of reference to the Gaelic, are
  quite enough to establish the existence and continuance of an aspirate,
  until we arrive at the French; and it has already been proved, that many
  words which lose the aspirate in French do not lose it in English. The
  progress from the Sanscrit is very clear:</p>

  <p><i>Sanscrit.</i> <i>Kshama.</i></p>

  <p><i>Pracrit.</i> <i>Khama.</i></p>

  <p><i>Old Greek.</i> <span title="Chama" class="grk"
  >&Chi;&#x1F71;&mu;&alpha;</span>; whence <span title="chamai" class="grk"
  >&chi;&#x1F71;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span>, <span title="chamaze" class="grk"
  >&chi;&#x1F71;&mu;&alpha;&zeta;&epsilon;</span>, <span title="chthamalos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&theta;&alpha;&mu;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Latin.</i> <i>Humus</i>, <i>humilis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Italian.</i> <i>Umile</i>; because there is in Italian no initial
  aspirate.</p>

  <p><i>French.</i> <i>&rsquo;Humble</i>; because in words of Latin origin
  the French almost always omit the aspirate.</p>

  <p><i>English.</i> <i>&lsquo;Humble.</i></p>

  <p>And here it may be observed, that <i>humilis</i> never had, except in
  the Vulgate and in ecclesiastical writers, the metaphorically Christian
  sense to which its derivatives in modern tongues are generally confined,
  and to which I believe the Gaelic <i>umhal</i> to be strictly confined.
  But the original words for <i>humble</i> are <i>iosal</i> and
  <i>iriosal</i>, cognate with the Irish <i>iosal</i> and <i>iriseal</i>,
  and the Cymric <i>isel</i>; and the olden and more established words for
  the earth are, both in Gaelic and Irish, <i>talamh</i> and <i>lar</i>,
  cognate with the Cymric <i>llawr</i>.</p>

  <p>All these facts lead to a reasonable suspicion that <i>uim</i>,
  <i>umhal</i>, and <i>umhailteas</i> (an evident naturalisation of a Latin
  word) are all derived from Latin at a comparatively recent date, as
  certainly as <i>umile</i>, <i>humilde</i>, <i>&rsquo;humble</i>, and
  <i>&lsquo;humble</i> are, and in the same Christian sense. The omission
  of an aspirate in the Gaelic word is then easily accounted for, without
  supposing it not to exist in other languages, and for this very simple
  reason, that no Gaelic word commences with <i>h</i>. There are
  <i>some</i> Celtic roots undoubtedly in the Latin language. It would be
  difficult, for example, to derive <i>m&oelig;nia</i>, <i>munire</i>,
  <i>gladius</i>, <i>vir</i>, and <i>virago</i> from any other origin, but
  much the larger number of words, in which the two languages resemble each
  other, are either adoptions from the Latin or derivatives from one common
  source, e. g. <i>mathair</i> and <i>mother</i>, <i>brathair</i> and
  <i>brother</i>, as well as the Latin <i>mater</i> and <i>frater</i>, from
  the Sanscrit <i>matri</i> and <i>bhratri</i>, &amp;c., as all comparative
  philologists are well aware. Would your correspondents call it the
  <i>&rsquo;Ebrew</i> language, because a Gael calls it, as he must do,
  <i>Eabrach</i>?</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>The Calotype Process: curling up of Paper.</i>&mdash;I am happy in
  having the opportunity of replying to your correspondent C. E. F. (Vol.
  ix., p. 16.), because, with himself, I have found great annoyance from
  the curling up of <i>some</i> specimens of paper. In the papers recently
  sold as Turner's, I find this much increased upon his original make, so
  much so that, until I resorted to the following mode, I spoiled several
  sheets intended for negatives, by staining the back of the paper, and
  which thereby gave a difference of intensity when developed after
  exposure in the camera.</p>

  <p>I have provided myself with some very thick extra white blotting-paper
  (procured of Sandford). This being thoroughly damped, and placed between
  two pieces of slate, remains so for many weeks. If the paper intended to
  be used is properly interleaved between this damp blotting-paper, and
  allowed to remain there twelve hours at least before it is to be iodized,
  it will be found to work most easily. It should be barely as damp as
  paper which is intended to be printed on. <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span>This arrangement will be
  found exceedingly useful for damping evenly cardboard and printed
  positives when they are intended to be mounted, so as to ensure their
  perfect flatness.</p>

  <p>It is quite immaterial whether the paper is floated on a solution or
  applied with a glass rod. If a very few sheets are to be manipulated
  upon, then, for economy, the glass rod is preferable; but if several, the
  floating has the advantage, because it ensures the most even application.
  I sent you a short paragraph (Vol. ix., p. 32.) showing how we may be
  deceived in water-marks upon paper; and when we are supposing ourselves
  to be using a paper of a particular date, in fact we are not doing
  so.</p>

  <p>I would also caution your photographic correspondents from being
  deceived in the quality of a paper by the exceeding high gloss which is
  given it by extra hot-pressing. This is very pleasing to the eye, and
  would be a great advantage if the paper were to remain dry; but in the
  various washings and soakings which it undergoes in the several processes
  before the perfect picture is formed, the artificial surface is entirely
  removed, and it is only upon a paper of a natural firm and even make that
  favourable results will be procured.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. W. Diamond.</span></p>

  <p><i>Turner's Paper.</i>&mdash;There is great difficulty in procuring
  good paper of Turner's make; he having lately undertaken a contract for
  Government in making paper for the new stamps, the manufacture of paper
  for photographic purposes has been to him of little importance. In fact,
  this observation, of the little importance of photographic compared to
  other papers, applies to all our great paper-makers, who have it in their
  power to make a suitable article. Mr. Towgood of St. Neots has been
  induced to manufacture a batch expressly for photography; but we regret
  to say that, although it is admirably adapted for albumenizing and
  printing positives, it is not favourable for iodizing, less so than his
  original make for ordinary purposes. All manufacturers, in order to
  please the eye, use bleaching materials, which deteriorate the paper
  chemically. They should be thoroughly impressed with the truth, that
  colour is of little consequence. A <i>bad-coloured paper</i> is of no
  importance; it is the extraneous substances in the paper itself which do
  the mischief.</p>

  <p><i>A Practical Photographic Query.</i>&mdash;I have never had a
  practical lesson on photography. I have worked it out as far as I could
  myself, and I have derived much information in reading the pages of "N.
  &amp; Q.," so that now I consider myself (although we are all apt to
  flatter ourselves) an average good manipulator. Independently of the
  information you have afforded me, I have read all the works upon
  photography which I could procure; and as the most extensive one is that
  by Mr. Robert Hunt, I went to the Exhibition of the Photographic Society
  just opened, thinking I might there see his works, and gain that
  information from an inspection of them which I desired. My disappointment
  was great on finding that Mr. Hunt does not exhibit, nor have I been able
  to see any of his specimens elsewhere. May I ask if Mr. Hunt <i>ever</i>
  attempts anything practically, or is it to the <i>theory of
  photography</i> alone that he directs his attention?</p>

  <p>I begin to fear, unless he lets a little of each go hand-in-hand, that
  he will mislead some of us amateurs, although I am quite sure
  unintentionally; for personally I much respect him, having a high opinion
  of his scientific attainments.</p>

  <p>"<i>Service is no Inheritance</i>" (Vol. viii., p. 587.; Vol. ix., p.
  20.).&mdash;P. C. S. S. confesses that he is vulgar enough to take great
  delight in Swift's <i>Directions to Servants</i>, a taste which he had
  once the good fortune of hearing avowed by no less a man than Sir W.
  Scott himself. G. M. T., who (Vol. viii., p. 587.) quotes the <i>Waverley
  Novels</i> for the use of the phrase "Service is no inheritance," will
  therefore scarcely be surprised to find that it occurs frequently in
  Swift's <i>Directions</i>, and especially in those to the "Housemaid,"
  chap. x. (<i>quod vide</i>).</p>

  <p><i>Francis Browne</i> (Vol. viii., p. 639)&mdash;It is not stated in
  the general pedigrees when or where he died, whether single or married.
  His sister Elizabeth died unmarried, Nov. 27, 1662; and his elder
  brother, Sir Henry Browne of Kiddington, in 1689. A reference to their
  wills, if proved, might afford some information if he, Francis, survived
  either of these dates. The will of Sir Henry Knollys, of Grove Place,
  Hants, the grandfather, might be referred to with the same view, and the
  respective registers of Kiddington and Grove Place.</p>

  English Catholics</i>, published in the year 1820, p. 239. It published a
  stereotype edition of the New Testament without the usual distinction of
  verses, and very few notes. The whole scheme was severely reprobated by
  Dr. Milner, on grounds stated by him in the Appendix to the
  <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 302. The Society soon expired, and no tracts or
  reports were, I believe, ever published by it. The correspondence between
  Mr. Charles Butler and Mr. Blair will be found in the <i>Gentleman's

  barrister receiving his first bag from one of the king's counsel, reminds
  me that there are many other legal practices, both obsolete and extant,
  which it would be curious and <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  illustrative of the habits of our forefathers, and the changes that time
  has produced. I recognise many among your coadjutors who are well able to
  contribute, either from tradition or personal experience, something that
  is worth recording, and thus by their mutual communications to form a
  collection that would be both interesting and useful. Let me commence the
  heap by depositing the first stones.</p>

  <p>1. My father has informed me that in his early years it was the
  universal practice for lawyers to attend the theatre on the last day of
  term. This was at a period when those who went into the boxes always wore
  swords.</p>

  <p>2. It was formerly (within fifty years) the custom for every barrister
  in the Court of Chancery to receive from the usher, or some other officer
  of the court, as many buns as he made motions on the last day of Term,
  and to give a shilling for each bun.</p>

  <p><i>Silo</i> (Vol. viii., p. 639.).&mdash;The word <i>silo</i> is
  derived from the Celtic <i>siol</i>, grain, and <i>omh</i>, a cave;
  <i>siolomh</i>, pronounced <i>sheeloo</i>, a "grain cave." Underground
  excavations have been discovered in various parts of Europe, and it is
  probable that they were really used for storing grain, and not for
  habitations, as many have supposed.</p>

  the mean time I remark that the Arab subterranean granaries, often used
  by the French as temporary prisons for refractory soldiers, are termed by
  then <i>silos</i> or <i>silhos</i>.</p>

  and in the neat Italian hand of the period the following anagram. The

  <p><i>Passage in Sophocles</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 73. 478.

  and referring it not to <span title="Theos" class="grk"

  <span title="Prassei" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;</span>, the old reading

  the same person: <i>Ille vero versatur</i>, &amp;c. <span class="sc">Mr.

  which is the relative to <span title="noun" class="grk"

  <span title="bonleuetai" class="grk"

  as if it were equivalent with <span title="bouletai" class="grk"
  >&beta;&omicron;&#x1F7B;&lambda;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;</span>. <span

  <i>destruction</i>, but <i>infatuation, mental delusion; that judicial
  blindness which leads a man to his ruin</i>, not the ruin itself. It is a
  leading idea in the Homeric theology (<i>Il.</i> xix. 88., xxiv. 480.,
  &amp;c.).</p>

  <p>Though the idea in the Antigone closely resembles that which is cited
  in the Scholia, it seems more than probable that the original source of
  both passages is derived from some much earlier author than a cotemporary
  of Sophocles. As to the line given in Boswell, it is not an Iambic verse,
  nor even Greek. It was probably made out of the Latin by some one who
  would try his hand, with little knowledge either of the metre or the
  language. <span class="sc">Mr. Buckton</span> says, that to translate
  late <span title="oligoston" class="grk"

  <i>very short</i>, is not to translate agreeably to the admonition of the

  <p><i>B. L. M.</i> (Vol. viii., p. 585.).&mdash;The letters B. L. M., in
  the subscription of Italian correspondence, stand for <i>bacio le
  mani</i> (I kiss your hands), a form nearly equivalent to "your most
  obedient servant." In the present instance the inflection <i>baciando</i>
  (kissing) is intended.</p>

  <p class="author">W. S. B.</p>

  <p>"<i>The Forlorn Hope</i>" (Vol. viii., pp. 411. 569.).&mdash;For
  centuries the "forlorn hope" was called, and is still called by the
  Germans, <i>Verlorne Posten</i>; by the French, <i>Enfans perdus</i>; by
  the Poles and other Slavonians, <i>Stracona poczta</i>: meaning, in each
  of those three languages, a detachment of troops, to which the commander
  of an army assigns such a perilous post, that he entertains no hope of
  ever rescuing it, or rather gives up all hope of its salvation. In
  detaching these men, he is conscious of the fate that awaits them; but he
  sacrifices them to save the rest of his army, <i>i. e.</i> he sacrifices
  a part for the safety of the whole. In short, he has no other intention,
  no other thought in so doing, than that which the adjective
  <i>forlorn</i> conveys. Thus, for instance, in Spain, a detachment of 600
  students volunteered to become a <i>forlorn hope</i>, in order to defend
  the passage of a bridge at Burgos, to give time to an Anglo-Spanish corps
  (which was thrown into disorder, and closely pursued by a French corps of
  18,000 men) to rally. The students all, to the last man, perished; but
  the object was attained.</p>

  <p>It much grieves me thus to sap the foundation of the idle speculation
  upon a word the late Dr. Graves indulged in, and which Mr. W. R. Wilde
  inserted in the <i>Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science</i> for
  February, 1849; but, on the other hand, I rejoice to have had the
  opportunity of endeavouring to destroy the very erroneous supposition,
  that Lord Byron had fallen into an error in his beautiful line:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The full of hope, misnamed <i>forlorn</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>What the late Dr. Graves meant by <i>haupt</i> or <i>hope</i>, for
  head, I am at a loss to conceive. <i>Haupt</i>, in German, it is true,
  means <i>head</i>; but in speaking of a small body of men, marching at
  the head of an army, no German would ever say <i>Haupt</i>, but
  <i>Spitze</i>. As to <i>hope</i> (another word for <i>head</i>) I know
  not from what language he took it; certainly not from the Saxon, for in
  that tongue <i>head</i> was called <i>heafod</i>, <i>hefed</i>, or
  <i>heafd</i>; whilst <i>hope</i> was called <i>hopa</i>, not
  <i>hope</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Two Brothers of the same Christian Name</i> (Vol. viii.,
  p.338.).&mdash;I have recently met with another instance of this
  peculiarity. John Upton, of Trelaske, Cornwall, an ancestor of the Uptons
  of Ingsmire Hall, Westmoreland, had two sons, living in 1450, to both of
  whom he gave the Christian name of John. The elder of these alike-named
  brothers is stated by Burke, in his <i>History of the Landed Gentry</i>,
  to have been the father of the learned Dr. Nicholas Upton, canon of
  Salisbury and Wells, and afterwards of St. Paul's, one of the earliest
  known of our authors on heraldic subjects. The desire of the elder Upton
  to perpetuate his own Christian name may in some way account for this
  curious eccentricity.</p>

  preserved in Gutch's <i>Collectanea Curiosa</i>, and printed in the

  sentiment is thus expressed:</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of "Mammet"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 515.).&mdash;It may help
  to throw light on this question to note that Wiclif's translation of 2
  Cor. vi. 16. reads thus: "What consent to the temple of God with
  <i>mawmetis</i>?" Calfhill, in his <i>Answer to Martiall</i> (ed. Parker
  Soc., p. 31.), has the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Gregory, therefore, if he had lived but awhile longer; and had seen
  the least part of all the miseries which all the world hath felt since,
  only for maintenance of those <i>mawmots</i>; he would, and well might,
  have cursed himself, for leaving behind him so lewd a precedent."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And at p. 175. this,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That Jesabel Irene, which was so bewitched with superstition, that
  all order, all honesty, all law of nature broken, she cared not what she
  did, so she might have her <i>mawmots</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>See also the editor's note on the use of the word in this last
  passage. In Dorsetshire, among the common people, the word <i>mammet</i>
  is in frequent use to designate a puppet, a doll, an odd figure, a
  scarecrow.</p>

  <p>I have been accustomed to teach my boys that <i>legend</i> (à
  <i>lego</i>, to read) is not strictly to be confined to the ordinary
  translation of its derivative, since the Latin admits of several
  readings, and among them, by the usage of Plautus, <i>to hearken</i>;
  whence our English substantive takes equal license to admit of <i>a
  relation</i> = <i>a narrative</i>, viz. "a thing to be heard;" and in
  this sense by custom has referred to many a gossip's tale.</p>

  <p>Having thus ventured to defend the use of <i>legend</i> by your
  correspondent (Vol. v., p. 196.), I submit to the illuminating power of
  your pages the following novel use of a word I have met with in the
  course of reading this morning, and shall be gratified if some of your

  bull's-eye on it with equal advantage to its employer.</p>

  <p><i>Richard I.</i> (Vol. viii., p. 72.).&mdash;I presume that the

  was not even monarch of any of the petty kingdoms of the Heptarchy, much
  less of all England. However, not to go farther with a subject which
  might lead to polemical controversy, surely <span class="sc">Mr.

  from the Conquest, and that three Edwards, who had much more right to be
  styled kings of England than Richard could have possibly had, are not
  counted in the number of kings of that name; the reason was, I believe,
  that these princes, although the paramount rulers of the country, styled
  themselves much more frequently Kings of the West Saxons than Kings of
  England.</p>

  <p><i>Lord Clarendon and the Tubwoman</i> (Vol. vii., p. 211.).&mdash;I
  regret having omitted "when found, to make a note of," the number of
  Chambers' <i>Edinburgh Journal</i> in which I met with the anecdote
  referred to about Sir Thomas Aylesbury, which is given at considerable
  length; and having lent my set of "Chambers" to a friend at a distance, I
  cannot at present furnish the reference required; but L. will find it in
  one of the volumes between 1838 and 1842 inclusive. I do not recollect
  that the periodical writer gave his authority for the tale, but while it
  may very possibly be true as regards the wife of Sir Thomas Aylesbury, it
  is evident that his daughter, a wealthy heiress, could never have been in
  such a position; and it is not recorded that Lord Clarendon had any other
  wife.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. S. Warden.</span></p>

  <p><i>Oaths</i> (Vol. viii., p. 605.).&mdash;Archbishop Whitgift, in a
  sermon before Queen Elizabeth, thus addresses her:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As all your predecessors were at this coronation, so you also were
  sworn before all the nobility and bishops then present, and in the
  presence of God, and in His stead to him that anointed you, 'to maintain
  the church lands and the rights belonging to it;' and this <i>testified
  openly at the Holy Altar, by laying your hands on the Bible then lying
  upon it</i>. (See Walton's <i>Lives</i>, Zouch's ed., p. 243.)"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I quote from the editor's introduction to Spelman's <i>History of
  Sacrilege</i>, p. 75., no doubt correctly cited.</p>

  <p class="author">H. P.</p>

  <p><i>Double Christian Names</i> (Vol. vii. <i>passim</i>).&mdash;The
  earliest instances of these among British subjects that I have met with,
  are in the families of James, seventh Earl, and Charles, eighth Earl, of
  Derby, both of whom married foreigners; the second son of the former by
  Charlotte de la Tremouille, born 24th February, 1635, and named Henry
  Frederick after his grand-uncle, the stadt-holder, is perhaps the
  earliest instance to be found.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. S. Warden.</span></p>

  <p><i>Chip in Porridge</i> (Vol. i., p. 382. Vol. viii., p.
  208.).&mdash;The subjoined extract from a newspaper report (Nov. 1806) of
  a speech of Mr. Byng's, at the Middlesex election, clearly indicates the
  meaning of the phrase:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It has been said, that I have played the game of Mr. Mellish. I have,
  however, done nothing towards his success. I have rendered him neither
  service nor disservice" ["No, nor to anybody else," said a person on the
  hustings; "you are a mere <i>chip in porridge</i>."]</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">W. R. D. S.</p>

  <p><i>Clarence Dukedom</i> (Vol. viii., p. 565.).&mdash;W. T. M. will
  find a very interesting paper on this subject, by Dr. Donaldson, in the
  <i>Journal of the Bury Archæological Society</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">G.</p>

  <p><i>Prospectuses</i> (Vol. viii., p. 562.).&mdash;I have seen a very
  curious volume of prospectuses of works contemplated and proposed, but
  which have never appeared, and wherein may be found much interesting
  matter on all departments of literature. A collection of this description
  would not only be useful, but should be preserved. A list of contemplated
  publications during the last half century, collected from such sources,
  would not be misplaced in "N. &amp; Q.," if an occasional column could be
  devoted to the subject.</p>

  <p class="author">G.</p>

  <p>"<i>I put a spoke in his wheel</i>" (Vol. viii., pp. 464. 522.
  576.).&mdash;This phrase must have had its origin in the days in which
  the vehicles used in this country had wheels of solid wood without
  spokes. Wheels so constructed I have seen in the west of England, in
  Ireland, and in France. A recent traveller in Moldo-Wallachia relates
  that the people of the country go from place to place mounted on horses,
  buffaloes, or oxen; but among the Boyards it is "fashionable" to make use
  of a vehicle which holds a position in the scale of conveyances a little
  above a wheelbarrow and little below a dung-cart. It is poised on four
  wheels of solid wood of two feet diameter, which are more or less rounded
  by means of an axe. A vehicle used in the cultivation of the land on the
  slopes of the skirts of Dartmoor in Devonshire, has three wheels of solid
  wood; it resembles a huge wheelbarrow, with two wheels behind, and one in
  front of it, and has two long handles like the handles of a plough,
  projecting behind for the purpose of guiding it. It is known as "the old
  three-wheeled But." As the horse is attached to the vehicle by chains
  only, and he has no power to hold it back when going down hill, the
  driver is provided with a piece of wood, "a spoke," which is of the shape
  of the wooden pin used for rolling paste, for the purpose of "dragging"
  the front wheel of the vehicle. This he effects by thrusting the spoke
  into one of the three round holes made in the solid wheel for that
  purpose. The operation of "putting a spoke in a wheel by way of
  impediment" may be seen in daily use on the three-wheeled carts used by
  railway navvies, and on the tram waggons with four wheels used in
  collieries to convey coals from the pit's mouth.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Every lover of Goldsmith&mdash;and who ever read one page of his
  delightful writings without admiring the author, and loving the
  man&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"... for shortness call Noll,</p>
      <p>Who wrote like an angel, but talk'd like poor Poll?"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>must be grateful to Mr. Murray for commencing his New Series of the
  <i>British Classics</i> with the <i>Works of</i> <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span><i>Oliver Goldsmith</i>,
  edited by Peter Cunningham, F.S.A. The Series is intended to be
  distinguished by skilful editorship, beautiful and legible type, fine
  paper, compactness of bulk, and economy of price. Accordingly, these
  handsome library volumes will be published at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each.
  If Mr. Murray has shown good tact in choosing Goldsmith for his first
  author, he has shown equal judgment in selecting Mr. Cunningham for his
  editor. Our valued correspondent, it is well known, and will be proved to
  the world when he gives us his new edition of Johnson's <i>Lives of the
  Poets</i> (which by the bye is to be included in this Series of Murray's
  <i>British Classics</i>), has long devoted himself to the history of the
  lives and writings of the poets of the past century. But in the present
  instance Mr. Cunningham has had peculiar advantages. Besides his own
  collections for an edition of Goldsmith, he has had the free and
  unrestricted use of the collections formed for the same purpose by Mr.
  Forster and Mr. Corney: a liberality on the part of those gentlemen which
  deserves the recognition of all true lovers of literature. With such aid
  as this, and his own industry and ability to boot, it is little wonder
  that Mr. Cunningham has been able to produce under Mr. Murray's auspices
  the best, handsomest, and cheapest edition of Goldsmith which has ever
  issued from the press.</p>

  <p>Of all the critics of Mr. Dod's <i>Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage
  of Great Britain and Ireland</i>, Mr. Dod is himself at once the most
  judicious and unsparing; and the consequence is, that every year he
  reproduces his admirable compendium with some additional feature of value
  and interest. For instance, in the volume for 1854, which has just been
  issued, we find, among many other improvements, that, at a very
  considerable cost, the attempt made in 1852 to ascertain and record the
  birthplace of every person who is the possessor, or the next heir, of any
  title of honour, has been renewed and extended with such success, that
  many hundred additional birthplaces are now recorded; and the unknown
  remnant has become unimportant. These statements are perfectly new and
  original, acquired from the highest sources in each individual case, and
  wholly unprecedented in the production of peerage-books.</p>
